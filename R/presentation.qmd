## Introduction

Gene expression data from blood samples collected using the affymetrix microarray platform. - 20 healthy patients (control) - 40 patients dianosed with sporadic Parkinsons Disease, who have yet to recieve drug treatment.

## Methods

-   Cleaning of dataset
-   Statistical Analyses:
-   
    -   PCA
-   
    -   Differential Expression
-   
    -   Differential Expression of known biomarker gene

## PCA

## Diff. Expression

## Diff. Expression of known biomarkers

## Analysis

## Discussion

Something comparing their results to ours?
