## Introduction

Gene expression data from blood samples collected using the affymetrix microarray platform. - 20 healthy patients (control) - 40 patients dianosed with sporadic Parkinsons Disease, who have yet to recieve drug treatment.

## Methods

-   Cleaning of dataset
-   Statistical Analyses:
-   
    -   PCA
-   
    -   Differential Expression
-   
    -   Differential Expression of known biomarker gene

## PCA

```{r}
# Load the image
pca <- load.image("../results/PCA_plot.png")

# Display the image without re-plotting
grid.raster(pca)
```

## Diff. Expression

## Diff. Expression of known biomarkers

## Analysis

## Discussion

Something comparing their results to ours?
