## Introduction

Gene expression data (Affymetrix platform).

Collected from the blood of:
-   20 healthy patients
-   40 patients diagnosed with sporadic Parkinsons disease


## Methods <!-- Luisa -->

-   Cleaning of dataset
-   Statistical Analyses:
-   
    -   PCA
-   
    -   Differential Expression
-   
    -   Differential Expression of known biomarker gene

## Results - PCA <!-- Rune -->

## Results - Diff. Expression <!-- David -->
<div style="background-color: white; padding: 10px; display:"> ![volcano](../results/06_Volcano_plot_gene_exp.png){width=80%}</div>


## Results - Diff. Expression of known biomarkers <!-- Luisa -->

## Conclusion <!-- Rune --> 

Something comparing their results to ours?
