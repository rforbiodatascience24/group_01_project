## Introduction <!-- David -->

Gene expression data from blood samples collected using the affymetrix microarray platform. - 20 healthy patients (control) - 40 patients dianosed with sporadic Parkinsons Disease, who have yet to recieve drug treatment.

## Methods <!-- Luisa -->

-   Cleaning of dataset
-   Statistical Analyses:
-   
    -   PCA
-   
    -   Differential Expression
-   
    -   Differential Expression of known biomarker gene

## Results - PCA <!-- Rune -->

## Results - Diff. Expression <!-- David -->

## Results - Diff. Expression of known biomarkers <!-- Luisa -->

## Conclusion <!-- Rune --> 

Something comparing their results to ours?
